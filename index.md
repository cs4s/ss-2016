# Activities

We will do the following activities in today's workshop - *Lighbot* and *Making Apps with AppInventor*.
If you have any questions about these activities or Coding in general, please let us know.

## Lightbot

In this activity we will solve some puzzles in the Lightbot game. 
The Lightbot game is available to play online [here](https://lightbot.com/hocflash.html){:target="_blank"}, but it can also be downloaded on Android and iOS tablets and phones. 
In this game you use commands to write instructions (Code) for the Lightbot to move around a maze and light up.

## Making Apps with AppInventor

In this activity we will build some apps with AppInventor. 
AppInventor is a free *visual programming* language that you can use to create mobile apps with Android tablets and phones. 
A *visual programming* language uses dragging and dropping blocks to create programs, rather than typing out code (e.g. in a language like Python). 

In AppInventor you can use lots of different phone and tablet features (e.g. GPS and Text to Speech) and build many different types of apps. 
For some examples of apps that have been created with AppInventor, see [this website](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/stories.html){:target="_blank"}.

We will make two different apps today by following the tutorials linked below. 
Before making these apps we will have to do a quick tutorial to make sure that the tablet is connected and runnning smoothly.
If you are trying this at home, you are likely to be able to connect your tablet and phone up through WiFi, which is a lot easier than this, but unfortunately we cannot do it this way in this lab.

### Tutorial #1: Connecting the Tablet

- [Connecting the Tablet Tutorial (Word document)](connecting_activity.docx)

### Tutorial #2: HelloPurr

- [Hello Purr - Tutorial (Word document)](HelloPurr_activity.docx)
- [Hello Purr Resources (Zip)](HelloPurr_resources.zip)

### Tutorial #3: Magic 8-Ball

- [Magic 8-Ball - Part 1 Tutorial (Word document)](8Ball_activity.docx)
- [Magic 8-Ball Resources (Zip)](8Ball_resources.zip)

If you finish the first three tutorials before the end of the workshop, you can try the *Making Pong* tutorial.
You are also welcome to download this tutorial, which is in two parts, after the workshop and complete it at home.

### Tutorial #4: Making Pong

- [Making Pong - Part 1 Tutorial (Word document)](Pong_activity_part1.docx)
- [Making Pong - Part 2 Tutorial (Word document)](Pong_activity_part2.docx)
- [Pong Resources (Zip)](Pong_resources.zip)

You may want to create mobile or phone apps at home but don't have an Android tablet or phone.
Some other options are [TouchDevelop](https://www.touchdevelop.com/){:target="_blank"} (which works on almost every phone and computer) and [Swift Playgrounds](http://www.apple.com/au/swift/playgrounds/){:target="_blank"} (only for Apple phones and tablets).
