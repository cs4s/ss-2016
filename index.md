# Activities

We will do the following activities in today's workshop - *My Robotic Friends*, *Lighbot* and *Making Apps with AppInventor*.
If you have any questions about these activities or Coding in general, please let us know.

## My Robotic Friends

In this activity we will write code using paper and pen. 
This activity is called an "unplugged" activity because we are not using a computer.
Coding does not just involve typing out code on a computer. It also involves thinking about how to solve problems with computers, which is called *Computational Thinking*.

The programs we write will instruct someone (a "robot") to build a stack of cups.
We can't use any instructions in English (for example, "put the cup on top of the other one"), we can only use the six symbols the "robot" understands.

There's a video about this activity available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUXlZipzkFM){:target="_blank"}. This activity was created by [Thinkersmith](http://www.thinkersmith.org/curriculum.php){:target="_blank"}. 

## Lightbot

In this activity we will solve some puzzles in the Lightbot game. 
The Lightbot game is available to play online [here](https://lightbot.com/hocflash.html){:target="_blank"}, but it can also be downloaded on Android and iOS tablets and phones. 
In this game you use commands to write instructions (Code) for the Lightbot to move around a maze and light up.

## Making Apps with AppInventor

In this activity we will build some apps with AppInventor. 
AppInventor is a free *visual programming* language that you can use to create mobile apps with Android tablets and phones. 
A *visual programming* language uses dragging and dropping blocks to create programs, rather than typing out code (e.g. in a language like Python). 

In AppInventor you can use lots of different phone and tablet features (e.g. GPS and Text to Speech) and build many different types of apps. 
For some examples of apps that have been created with AppInventor, see [this website](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/stories.html){:target="_blank"}.

We will make two different apps today by following the tutorials linked below. 
The second tutorial (Making Pong) is in 2 parts.

### Tutorial #1: Magic 8-Ball

- [Magic 8-Ball - Part 1 Tutorial (Word document)](8Ball_activity.docx)
- [Magic 8-Ball Resources (Zip)](8Ball_resources.zip)

### Tutorial #2: Making Pong

- [Making Pong - Part 1 Tutorial (Word document)](Pong_activity_part1.docx)
- [Making Pong - Part 2 Tutorial (Word document)](Pong_activity_part2.docx)
- [Pong Resources (Zip)](Pong_resources.zip)

You may want to create mobile or phone apps at home but don't have an Android tablet or phone.
Some other options are [TouchDevelop](https://www.touchdevelop.com/){:target="_blank"} (which works on almost every phone and computer) and [Swift Playgrounds](http://www.apple.com/au/swift/playgrounds/){:target="_blank"} (only for Apple phones and tablets).
